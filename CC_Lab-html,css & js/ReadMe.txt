This is the website I created for one my games called sonic slash. I used html, css and javascript
to create this website which consists of the home page with the logo and a top-left navigation consisting of
home, about, rules and contact us. Each of these are linked to seperate pages with relevant information. 

Open the index.html file to view the website.

Thanks.
